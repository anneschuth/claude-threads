**Bring Claude Code to your team.** Run Claude Code on your machine, share it live in Mattermost or Slack. Colleagues can watch, collaborate, and run their own sessions—all from chat.

> *Think of it as screen-sharing for AI pair programming, but everyone can type.*

## Features

- **Real-time streaming** - Claude's responses stream live to chat
- **Multi-platform** - Connect to multiple Mattermost and Slack workspaces
- **Concurrent sessions** - Each thread gets its own Claude session
- **Session persistence** - Sessions survive bot restarts
- **Collaboration** - Invite others to participate in your session
- **Interactive permissions** - Approve Claude's actions via emoji reactions
- **Git worktrees** - Isolate changes in separate branches
- **Image attachments** - Attach images for Claude to analyze
- **Chrome automation** - Control Chrome browser for web tasks

## Quick Start

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install
bun install -g claude-threads

# Run the setup wizard
cd /your/project
claude-threads
```

The **interactive setup wizard** will guide you through everything:
- Configure Claude Code CLI (if needed)
- Set up your Mattermost or Slack bot
- Test credentials and permissions
- Get you up and running in minutes

**Need help with platform setup?** See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for Mattermost or Slack bot creation.

### Prerequisites

- **Bun 1.2.21+** - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Claude Code CLI working** - test with `claude --version` (needs API key or subscription)

Mention the bot in your chat:

@claude help me fix the bug in src/auth.ts
```

## Git Worktrees

Leave the allowed users list empty to let anyone in the channel use the bot (be careful!)
